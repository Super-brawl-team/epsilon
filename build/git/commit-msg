# The purpose of this script is to ensure consistent commit naming convention.
# It is called before each git commit and follows Angular guidelines for commit
# format (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)
#
# The header should be <type>(<optional-scope>): <description>
# The body is optional.

# Here are the accepted commit types: (https://github.com/pvdlg/conventional-commit-types)
# | Commit Type | Title                    | Description                                                                                                 |
